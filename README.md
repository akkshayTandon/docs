# Welcome to the Code Thesaurus docs!

## What is Code Thesaurus?

In a simple term, a polyglot developer reference tool.

What's that? It's basically a way to compare a language you know with a language you don't know. The idea is rather than having to parse a ton of documentation on a language, you can compare something you don't know to something you do, which will let you quickly figure out not just what to do but help you learn it as well. It's kind of like language immersion but for programming languages.

## What is the goal of this project?

To literally be able to look at any two programming languages and see how their structures ## and usages compare. 

A further down the road goal would be to be able to compare other things like database query commands, data structures, standard algorithms, and more.

## Who is behind this?

The brain behind this is [Sarah Withee](https://twitter.com/geekygirlsarah), a polyglot developer who has come to love and appreciate technology and all aspects of it. She's come to appreciate all programming languages for both their pros and cons, and definitely believes the best programming language is the one that solves the task the best (whatever that means).

## How does this work?

Feel free to see the [Architecture](docs/project_architecture.md) section, but the goal will be to have a website that can look into language meta files, pull out the information the user is looking for, and match up structures side-by-side. 

## Is this project available for Hacktoberfest contributions?

Yes! The Code Thesaurus code and documentation projects are both enabled for Hacktoberfest contributions.

## How can I help?

We're still in the early stages, but some options include:
* Look through the repo for issues or bugs 
* Add to the meta files to build up information about languages you know
* Help think through the future of what Code Thesaurus could be
* Find more developers of any experience level and background to help contribute!
