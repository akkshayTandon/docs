# Running the Application Manually

## Manual Install

Code Thesaurus is tested to run on at least Python 3.10, though it may work in earlier 3.x versions. It will not run in
Python 2.x.

If you run `python --version` and it shows Python 2.x but you know you have Python 3.x installed, you may need to
suffix all `python` and `pip` commands with `3`, e.g. `pip3` and `python3`, or follow the process for making Python
3 your default Python installation.

### Manual Install - Windows

1. Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/codethesaurus/codethesaur.us.git`
2. Switch into to the directory with `cd codethesaur.us`
3. Check to see if Python 3.x is installed with `python --version` or `python3 --version`. If Python 3.x isn't
   installed, visit [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) or if you
   have Chocolatey, install it with `choco install python`
4. Install Python's virtual environment venv with the command `pip3 install virtualenv`
5. To set up new virtual environment, run `virtualenv venv`
6. To activate virtual environment, run `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
7. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the needed dependencies
8. Then run `python manage.py runserver` to start the server
9. In your browser, visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
10. Press CTRL+C in the terminal to stop the server
11. To deactivate the virtual environment, run `venv\Scripts\deactivate.bat`

### Manual Install - Mac

Note: These instructions only work on Intel-based Macs. For the new M1 Macs, the basic installation process is about the
same, but you may need to review directions on Homebrew's website to see how to properly install Python. We hope to
update these directions soon.

1. Check to see if Python 3.x is installed with `python --version` or `python3 --version`. If Python 3.x isn't
   installed, install it with `brew install python`
2. Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/codethesaurus/codethesaur.us.git`
3. Switch into to directory with `cd codethesaur.us`
4. Run `pip3 install virtualenv`
5. To set up new virtual environment, run `virtualenv venv`
6. To activate virtual environment, run `source venv/bin/activate`
7. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all the needed dependencies
8. Then run `python3 manage.py runserver` to start the server
9. In your browser, visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
10. Press CTRL+C in the terminal to stop the server
11. To deactivate the virtual environment, run `deactivate`

### Manual Install - Linux

Note: Instructions will often vary greatly depending on what distribution of Linux you are running. For more info, please
search online for instructions on using your distribution's package manager.

1. Check to see if the system default `python --version` works. If the returned text is not python 3.x then try using
   `python3 --version`. If both `python` and `python3` are installed, use whichever is the latest version.
2. You may need to install PostgreSQL as well. Use your package manager (often `apt`, `apt-get`, or `pacman`) to install
   the `postgresql` package.
3. Install venv for virtual environment with `sudo apt install -y python3-venv`
4. Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/codethesaurus/codethesaur.us.git`
5. Switch into to directory with `cd codethesaur.us`
6. Set up the Python virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`
7. Activate the virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`
8. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
9. Then run the app with `python3 manage.py runserver`
10. In your browser, visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
11. Press CTRL+C in the terminal to stop the server
12. To deactivate the virtual environment, run `deactivate`
