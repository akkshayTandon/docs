# Welcome to the Code Thesaurus documentation!

## What is Code Thesaurus?

It is a polyglot developer reference tool originally created to help you compare a language you know with one you don't. The main purpose is to be a quick and easy way to help people that use a lot of programming languages and have to context switch between them. It also allows you to pick up how to use a new programming language fast without needing to read documentation.

## tl;dr Getting Started

_While we recommend reading over the docs for the part of the site you're working on, we realize many like to get started ASAP!_

1. Pull down the [main site repo](https://github.com/codethesaurus/codethesaur.us/) from GitHub.
2. [Build the Docker container](install/install-ct-docker.md).
3. [Run the site](install/install-ct-docker.md).
4. The code is linked into the container, so changes take effect immediately upon saving.
5. Find one of our [dozens of available issues](https://github.com/codethesaurus/codethesaur.us/issues), the vast majority of them [looking for help](https://github.com/codethesaurus/codethesaur.us/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

Issues almost always have enough context that you don't need to read the docs unless you need more specific information.

If you're newer to open source, grab one of our ["Good First Issue" issues](https://github.com/codethesaurus/codethesaur.us/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
